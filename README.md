# Puppies_vs._Aliens_Video_Game
Classic arcade game using PyGame and Python

Create a folder on your desktop.  Download the script, and save it in the folder.  Then create two folders in the first folder, one for the images called "images" and the second for the sounds called "sounds."  Once you've installed the packages, it should run as is.  

If you want to create your own video game, I recommend googling free sprites.  There are lots of free sprites out there that you can use to replace the images in this game and create your own video game from this template.  You can change the music, and mess around with the format however you want. Enjoy!
