Classic arcade game using PyGame and Python

Did you know that the classic arcade companies of the 1970s and 80s were among the first to commercialize #artificialintelligence?

This past weekend, I built an arcade-inspired video game with both enemy and friendly AIs using #python #programming and #pygame. Thanks to my friends Rishabh Wagh and Shih-Tien (Eric) Wang for their help in constructing the game.
