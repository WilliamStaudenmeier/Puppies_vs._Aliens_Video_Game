Did you know that climatologists are beginning to use #artificialintelligence and #machinelearning to fine tune their climate models? According to one such model by NOAA: National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, the world's sea level could rise by as much as six meters in the next 80 years as a result of global warming.

This past weekend, my friend Krishangi Deka and I built a computer simulation to see what six meters of difference might look like across the world. Krishangi is a data scientist and a student at the University of Illinois working part-time at Clean My Planet.

From an #r #programming perspective, you can use the #elevatr package to pull #geospatialdata for any lat/long coordinates in the world and #rayshader to simulate different scenarios.
